# JS Fundamentals Checkpoint 9 Drills

Objective: By the end of this checkpoint, students can implement asynchronous code.
Explain the problems that callbacks solve:
asynchronous code
iterations that repeat logic
when we want to return multiple values instead of just one return statement (async)
Examples of pre-built functions that accept callbacks. Refactor them to show we're passing the functions, not the return values. For example, array methods.
Introduce methods like setTimeout and setInterval to demonstrate clocks and simple animations.
Examples of writing custom functions that accept callbacks as parameters and then call the callbacks.
Call out that functions are "first class" so can be passed around like variables.
Assignment: Drills that expand on the set from checkpoint 7 (answering questions about data)
As well as setTimeout / setImmediate / maybe `new Date()`
Higher order functions
